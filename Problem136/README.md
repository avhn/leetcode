## 136. Single Number

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [2,2,1]
<b>Output:</b> 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [4,1,2,1,2]
<b>Output:</b> 4
</pre>
