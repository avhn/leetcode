[![Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/Anaxilaus/LeetCode/tree/master/Problem1)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
