## 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3,1]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [2,7,9,3,1]
<b>Output:</b> 12
<b>Explanation:</b> Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
