## 53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
<b>Output:</b> 6
<b>Explanation:</b> [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
</pre>

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
