## 189. Rotate Array

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by *k* steps, where *k* is non-negative.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
<b>Output:</b> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
<b>Explanation:</b>
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
<b>Output:</b> [3,99,-1,-100]
<b>Explanation:</b>
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
</pre>

**Note:**

- Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
