## 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

We should return its level order traversal:
<pre>
[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]
</pre>

**Note:**

1. The depth of the tree is at most `1000`.
2. The total number of nodes is at most `5000`.
