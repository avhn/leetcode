## 69. Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 4
<b>Output:</b> 2
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 8
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
